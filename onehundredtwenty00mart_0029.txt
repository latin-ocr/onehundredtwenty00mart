E pigv‘ams (gf Μιτνῑῑάί. 9

 

Tam longe est mihi quam Terentianus,

Qui nunc Niliacam regit Syenen.

Non convivere, nec videre saltim,

Non audire licet, nec urbe tota

Quisquam est tam prope tam proculque nobis. 5
Migrandum est mihi longius vel illi.

Vicinus Novio vel inquilinus

Sit, si quis Novium videre non vult.

My neighbor Hunks’s house and mine
Are built so near they almost join3

The windows, too, project so much,
That through the casements we may touch.
Nay, I'm so happy, most rnen think,
To live so near a man of chink,

That they are apt to envy me,

For keeping such good company:

But he's as far from me, I vow,

As London is from good Lord Howe;
For when old Hunks Ι chance to meet,
Or one or both must quit the street,
Thus he who would not see old Roger,
Must bc his neighbor or his lodger.

Enough, little book!

Ohe, iam satis 651, 0116, libelle,
Iam pervenimus usque acl umbilicos.

Tu procedere adhue et ire quaeris,

Nee summa potes in schida teneri,

Sic tanquam tibi res peracta non sit, 5
Quae prima quoque pagina peracta est.

Iam lector queriturque deficitque,

Iam librarius hoc et ipse dicit

‘⁶ Ohe, iani satis est, 0116, 11116116.”

Non habui febrem, Symmache, nunc habeo.

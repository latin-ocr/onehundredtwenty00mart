86. (VIII. van.)

Caecilianus, invited to dinner at the ninth hour, came before the

fifth.

His host tells him he is too late for breakfast.

Horas quinque puer nondum tibi nuntiat, et tu
Iam conviva mihi, Caeciliane, venis,

Cum modo distulerint raucae vadimonia quartae
Et Floralicias lasset harena feras.

Curre, age, et inlotos revoca, Calliste, ministros; 5
Sternantur lecti : Caeciliane, sede.

Caldam poscis aquam : nondum mihi frigida venit3
Alget adhuc nudo clusa culina foco.

Mane veni potius 3 nam cur te quinta moretur?
Ut ientes‚ sero, Caeciliam, venis.

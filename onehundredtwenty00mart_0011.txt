INTRODUCTION.

WITHIN a narrow range Martial possessed a really
creative genius. He brought to its highest perfectiori
one form of poetry, and his work has been ever since
the model and type of the epigram in all the litera-
tures of the world, a model and type which have not
been surpassed in any literature.

In its original sense an epigram was a mere inscrip-
tion upon some material object, such as a monument,
a vase, or a votive offering. In its developed sense,
we may adopt Lessing's definition and call it ‘⁶ A poem
in which, after the manner of a real inscription, our
attention and curiosity are excited toward some single
object, and more or less held in suspense, in order to
be suddenly gratified.” ¹ It thus falls readily into two
parts: the first corresponding to the monument or
other material object, which arrests the attention and
arouses the curiosity,; the second corresponding to the
inscription by which that curiosity is satisfied. We
usually expect an epigram to be short. Nearly always,
if successful, it is witty, but it may be pathetic. The
conclusion must be pithy and pointed.

1 It is not pretended that this definitior] is in all respects satisfactory,
but it gives a fair idea of the structure of Martial's epigrams.

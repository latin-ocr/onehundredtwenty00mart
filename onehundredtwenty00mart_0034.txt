19. (ΙΙ. XVI.)

On one who feigned illness in order to display his handsome bed-
coverings.

Zoilus aegrotat: faciunt hane stragula febrem
Si fuerit sanus, coccina quid facient ?

Quid torus a Nilo, quid Sidone tinctus olenti?
Ostendit stultas quid nisi morbus opes?

Quid tibi cum medicis ? Dimitte Machaonas omnes. 5
Vis fieri sanus? Stragula sume mea.

20. (ΙΙ. xxx.)

To a friend who gave only advice, when asked to lend money.

Mutua viginti sestertia forte rogabam,
Quae vel donanti non grave munus erat.

Quippe rogabatur felixque vetusque sodalis
Et cuius laxas arca flagellat opes. 10
